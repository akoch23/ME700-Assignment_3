**Example 1: Discretization of a 2D element (linear, triangular)**,

The existing FEA discretization modules grant users the ability to analyze and visualize several finite element types. In this example, a 2D triangular element with 3 nodes will be used. To The user need only define these few variables:
- ele_type: 
- num_gauss_pts:
- - fname:
